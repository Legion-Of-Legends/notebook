# The 48 laws of power

## Law 1:  Never outshine the Master
Always  make the people above to feel superior.
You may think your talent and knowledge or expertisem
will gain you favor from the upper section. But rather
it's the opposite they will see you as a threat and try
to eleminate you. What you can do is to make them feel
superior and shine them and make yourself a little naive in front of them.
Remember they want someone that will bring **THEM** glory
not make them feel useless. Have paitence and let the nature
take it's course and **Don't overdo anything**.

## Law 2: Never put too much trust in friends, Learn how to use enemies
